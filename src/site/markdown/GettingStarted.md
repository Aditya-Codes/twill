### Maven dependencies
For your application module

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.twill</groupId>
    <artifactId>twill-api</artifactId>
    <version>0.2.0-incubating</version>
</dependency>
```

For the your Apache Twill YARN client module

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.twill</groupId>
    <artifactId>twill-yarn</artifactId>
    <version>0.2.0-incubating</version>
</dependency>
```


### Clone and build the Twill library
You can also clone the source and build the latest snapshot.

```sh
$ git clone https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-twill.git twill
$ cd twill
$ mvn clean install
```

### Quick example

Let's begin by building a basic `EchoServer` in Twill. Traditionally, when you build a server as simple as this,
you add logic within a `Runnable` implementation to run it in a `Thread` using an appropriate `ExecutorService`:

```java
public class EchoServer implements Runnable {
  private static Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(EchoServer.class);
  private final ServerSocket serverSocket;

  public EchoServer() {
    ...
  }

  @Override
  public void run() {
    while ( isRunning() ) {
      Socket socket = serverSocket.accept();
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

Our example defines an implementation of `Runnable` that implements the `run()` method.
The `EchoServer` is now a `Runnable` that can be executed by an `ExecutorService`:

```java
ExecutorService service = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);
service.submit(new EchoServer());
```

The above model is familiar, but now assume you want to run your `EchoServer` on a YARN cluster.
To do this, all you need to do is implement the `TwillRunnable` interface similarly to how you
normally implement `Runnable`:

```java
public class EchoServer implements TwillRunnable {

  private static Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(EchoServer.class);
  private final ServerSocket serverSocket;
  private final int port;

  public EchoServer() {
    ...
  }

  @Override
  public void run() {
    while ( isRunning() ) {
      Socket socket = serverSocket.accept();
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

To run `EchoServer` on the YARN cluster, you need a `TwillRunnerService`, which is similar to `ExecutorService`.
You can specify the YARN cluster configuration and connection string to a running instance of a Zookeeper service
to create an instance of `TwillRunnerService`:

```java
TwillRunnerService runnerService = new YarnTwillRunnerService(
  new YarnConfiguration(), zkConnectStr);
runnerService.startAndWait();
```

Now you are read to run the EchoServer on YARN, by simply preparing and starting through the `TwillRunnerService`. You
can also attach log handler to receives logs generated by EchoService running on some nodes in the cluster:

```java
TwillController controller = runnerService.prepare(new EchoServer())
  .addLogHandler(new PrinterLogHandler(new PrintWriter(System.out)))
  .start();
```

Now that the `EchoServer` is started and you can inspect or control the application through the `TwillController`.
For example, you can attach listeners for state changes:

```java
controller.addListener(new ListenerAdapter() {
  @Override
  public void running() {
    LOG.info('Echo Server Started');
  }
}
```

You can also stop the application through the `TwillController`:

```java
controller.stop().get();
```

This will shut down the application master and all the containers.

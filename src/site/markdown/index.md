### What is Twill?

Twill is an abstraction over Apache Hadoop® YARN that reduces the complexity of developing distributed applications,
allowing developers to focus more on their business logic. Twill allows you to use YARN’s distributed capabilities
with a programming model that is similar to running threads.
